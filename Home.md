# Ever met a myotonic goat?

Perhaps not, but you’ve likely heard of *fainting goats*. That is, goats
believed to possess a specific genetic disorder, a problem in their code if you
will.

When these particular goats are startled, a rotten bit code in their DNA causes
them to instinctively stiffen their legs. This leads to them falling over near
instantly, or at the very least, carrying on a *stiff-legged shuffle* around the
farm.

In a mix of both sadness and intense laughter, watching a goat nearly, though
quite literally, be scared to death can be enlightening. Interestingly enough,
it turns out this laughing stock of the barnyard is also a great metaphor for
applications with their own *bad code*. While scientists continue to study just
what’s going wrong in a myotonic goat’s code, you can now do the same,
metaphorically speaking of course.

Thanks for your interest!

# Hack, the WebGoat
 
WebGoat is a deliberately insecure application that allows interested developers
just like you to *test vulnerabilities* commonly found in Java-based
applications that use common and popular open source components.

Now, while we in no way condone causing intentional harm to any animal, goat or
otherwise, we think learning everything you can about security vulnerabilities
is essential to understanding just what happens when even a small bit of
*unintended code gets into your applications*.

What better way to do that than with your very own scapegoat?

Feel free to do what you will with Hack. Poke, prod and if it makes you feel
better, scare him until your heart’s content. *Go ahead, and Hack the goat*. We
promise he likes it.
