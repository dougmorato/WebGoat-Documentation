# Ever met a myotonic goat?

Perhaps not, but you’ve likely heard of *fainting goats*. That is, goats
believed to possess a specific genetic disorder, a problem in their code if you
will.

When these particular goats are startled, a rotten bit code in their DNA causes
them to instinctively stiffen their legs. This leads to them falling over near
instantly, or at the very least, carrying on a *stiff-legged shuffle* around the
farm.

In a mix of both sadness and intense laughter, watching a goat nearly, though
quite literally, be scared to death can be enlightening. Interestingly enough,
it turns out this laughing stock of the barnyard is also a great metaphor for
applications with their own *bad code*. While scientists continue to study just
what’s going wrong in a myotonic goat’s code, you can now do the same,
metaphorically speaking of course.
